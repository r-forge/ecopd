\alias{tipLength}
\title{Calculate distance to tips from ancestors}
\description{
  Returns the edge length between each tip and its parent, or
  alternatively the total distance to each tip from the root node of the
  phylogeny.
}
\usage{
  tipLength(phy, from=c("parent", "root"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{phy}{A \code{phylo4} object (or one that inherits from it)}
  \item{from}{Should lengths represent distance from parents only (i.e.,
    simply the lengths of terminal branches), or from the root node?}
}
\details{
  When \code{from} is \code{"parent"}, the function is a straightforward
  wrapper of the \code{edgeLength} function in the phylobase package.
  When \code{from} is \code{"root"}, the function uses an implementation
  of Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the total distance from the root to
  each of the tips.
}
\value{
  Numeric vector of lengths, with the associated tip node labels as
  names.
}
\note{
  When calculating the distance from root, the length of the root edge
  itself is \strong{not} included in the returned value. See examples
  for a simple way to add this additional edge to the result.
